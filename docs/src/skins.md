# Skins

Skins allow customization of font sizes, colors, dimensions, paddings and
spacings. Skins are created with a JSON that can contain any subset of the
assemble and render options.

A [template skin
file](https://github.com/coastalwhite/wavedrom-rs/tree/main/skins/template.json5)
can be found in the repository. Skins can also be previewed, edited and exported
from the editor by opening the `Render Settings`.
